## How to run?

## Run `./start.sh`

Docker v3.4+ is required.

## Production:

## Run `./start.sh`

or `cd production && docker-compose up`

> Note: in production, it's highly recommended to use `FORUM_BACKEND_SECRET` to secure private API endpoints.
>
> This can be done by generating a random string and passing it as an environment variable to docker compose:
>
> `FORUM_BACKEND_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) docker compose up`

### Other revisions: `./start.sh <revision>`

To run `main` branch version ([forum-ci.mer.pw](https://forum-ci.mer.pw))

```shell
./start.sh main
```

To run `pr-76` revision

```shell
./start.sh pr-76
```

To build and run local revision

```shell
./start.sh local
```

> Note: if there's no such revision for one of the services, the default `main` revision will be used.

### Natively (dev)

requirements: Node.js, Golang, GCC

Check frontend and backend READMEs for more information.

## Environment variables

Frontend and backend have their own environment variables. Check their READMEs for more information.

Here's the list of environment variables used by both:

- `FORUM_BACKEND_SECRET` - optional, secret `Internal-Auth` header value to bypass authentication for private API
  endpoints. If not set, private API endpoints will be available to anyone with `Internal-Auth` header set to any value.

- `FORUM_IS_PRIVATE` - optional, default: `true`.
  Makes all endpoints private by default. If set to `false`, some endpoints will be available to anyone (
  like `/api/posts`).
